           <h1 > Objective </h1>
           <p>The goal of the game is to be the first player to correctly construct a DNA strand, transcribe it into an RNA sequence,
             and then translate it into the correct amino acid chain that matches your hidden Protein Blueprint Card. 
             The game teaches the central dogma of molecular biology: DNA → RNA → Protein.

            <p>
                1. Shuffle the DNA Base Deck (cards labeled A, T, C, G).<br>
2. Shuffle the RNA Base Deck (cards labeled A, U, C, G).<br>
3. Give each player:
                *5 DNA base cards
                *1 hidden Protein Blueprint Card (shows an amino acid sequence)<br>
4. Place the Codon Chart and RNA deck face-down in the center.<br>
5. Optionally include Special Cards (Mutation, Splice, Frame Shift) for added strategy.

            <h2>Turn Structure</h2>
            <p>
                
Each player takes turns in clockwise order and completes the following phases:
1. Draw Phase: Optionally draw 1 DNA card.
2. DNA Construction: Build or add to your DNA strand until it has exactly 6 bases.
3. Transcription: Use RNA cards to transcribe each DNA base:
A → U, T → A, C → G, G → C
4. Translation: Group RNA bases into codons (3-letter sequences), then use the Codon Chart to decode each codon into an amino acid.
5. Verification: Compare your amino acid chain to your Protein Blueprint. If it doesn’t match, continue building or correcting in future turns.

           <h1 >Win Conditions</h1>
            <p>The first player to build a DNA strand, correctly transcribe it into RNA, and translate it into a protein sequence that matches their Protein Blueprint Card wins the game.
To prove a win, players must:
Read aloud their DNA and RNA sequences
Identify each codon 
Name the amino acid sequence and show that it matches the blueprint exactly
Mistakes result in drawing penalty cards and losing a turn.
